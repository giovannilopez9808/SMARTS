** WARNING #13 *********
\\ Ground reflectance data for CONCRETE                
\\ extend only from 0.3000 to 1.3000 �m,
\\ whereas the wavelength limits for this run are 0.2800 and 4.0000 �m.
\\ Consequently, reflectance is fixed at 0.186 below 0.3000 �m and at 0.486 above 1.3000 �m.


** WARNING #13 *********
\\ Ground reflectance data for DRY_LONG_GRASS          
\\ extend only from 0.2771 to 2.9760 �m,
\\ whereas the wavelength limits for this run are 0.2800 and 4.0000 �m.
\\ Consequently, reflectance is fixed at 0.008 below 0.2771 �m and at 0.003 above 2.9760 �m.
